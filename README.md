## Speeding up VR rendering with 3D warping

This is an ongoing project with the goal of speeding up VR rendering up to 50% by rendering images for one eye with 3D warping. Read the [introduction](https://github.com/abiro/vr-warp/wiki) or the [road map](https://github.com/abiro/vr-warp/wiki/Road-map) for more, or check out the [first demo.](https://github.com/abiro/vr-warp-demo-0) This code is heavily under development with a number of [issues](https://github.com/abiro/vr-warp/wiki/Bugs) and as such should not be used in production yet.

I am looking for collaborators to produce demos for test cases. Feedback is encouraged by opening an issue or by [e-mail.](https://www.agostbiro.com/index.html#contact)
